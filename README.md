# Cookie Stand - Lab 6

This project consists of using JavaScript Objects and DOM manipulation. The purpose is to help a cookie stand determine the average amount of sales per day they have given a certain volume of customers they receive on any given day.

Primary languages for this project are HTML and JavaScript and some CSS.

I plan on creating a table of all of the data collected on the customer volume to cookies being sold and even down to the best selling cookie flavors. 

I am currently working on simplifying the code for functionality on the website.
